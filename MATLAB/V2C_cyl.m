function vals = V2C_cyl(vals,a)
% This code takes as argument a matrix of function values at n-dimensional
% Chebyshev and equidistant points, as well as an "order" string that tells
% the computer which dimensions are sampled at equidistant (Fourier)
% points. It cycles through each dimension, performing a DCT or DFT as
% appropriate.
% 
% In the "order" string, the character 't' (or 'T') denotes "trigonometric"
% dimensions. These are the ones for which the DFT is used. The character
% '0' is used to denote a dimension not to transform.
% 
% The time complexity of this algorithm is K*log(K), where K =
% prod(size(vals)). It is done in place, so space requirements are O(K).
